# Jupyter Snippets
## What is this?
I'm really lazy to make same thing over and over again. So i usually make "boilterplates" and "modules" to reduce repetitive works so i can make more time to think than code and observe.

## What this repository have?
* Data visualization 
* Spark Query base
* awful python code
